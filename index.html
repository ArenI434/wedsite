        <p>Multiple weeks we worked on moustrap car.  The mousetrap car needs to move from one place to another by using the force of the rope that is revolving around the skewer of the CD.  First we worked on design in google documnent. After two weeks we started building the car and first testing was fine, the car moved about 15 inches.  </p>

        <p>We need to make boat that can go and float on the water.  Our group had two iterations.  First we took a half cup and put pieces of the popsicle stick under.  The boat float 90 cm.  Second boat we make for cardboard</p>

    <h3>carbord boat project </h3>
    <p> 
        The second boat that we designed has main rectangle and one end is half-circle.  I watched what my teammates did. The  half-circle end for front end we think will help to turn the boat easily.  One mistake from our team was that we did not considered that we need to be in the boat.  The boat did not went from one point to other.  Our boat sank.  It was fun expecienc.
